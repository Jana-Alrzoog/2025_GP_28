## Introduction
**Masar** is an AI-powered **Digital Twin system** designed to enhance passenger experience and optimize metro operations in the Riyadh Metro.  
The system predicts station crowd levels 30 minutes ahead, provides real-time congestion visualizations, and offers an intelligent dashboard for metro staff to monitor and manage high-traffic situations.  
Masar supports the goals of **Saudi Vision 2030** by enabling smarter, safer, and more efficient public transportation.
